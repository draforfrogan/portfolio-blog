After gaining some experience with KiCAD, I thought it would be cool to creat an entire 60% keyboard, using through hole (TH) components for a more unique look. 

### Design philosophy
This time I hade "aesthetics" in mind, and there are therefore exposed copper traces for a more raw/retro feel to the board.

#### Future revisions
* Free up SDA and SCL (to enable i2c) and add breakout pads

### Features
* 67 keys
* 1 (optional) rotary encoder
* Underglow breakout pins for use with a WS2812B LED strip
* Stepped caps lock option
* 6.25u and 7u spacebar
* ISO and ANSI compatible
