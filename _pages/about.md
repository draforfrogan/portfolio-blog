Foremost I enjoy problem solving, and the IT domain in general carries with it a plethora of interesting problems to look closer at. But, my problem solving interest is not contained to just programming or software engineering; I also enjoy more tangible projects, leaning towards the "maker" domain of projects. 

In my spare time I'm currently using CAD software quite often. The main programs being KiCAD (EDA software) and Autodesk Fusion 360. 

Feel free to look around a bit and explore some of the projects that I've published on this site, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. //Max
